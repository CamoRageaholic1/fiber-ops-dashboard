# This workflow has been disabled because Code Scanning requires GitHub Advanced Security
# which is only available for public repositories or with a paid GitHub plan.
#
# To enable this workflow:
# 1. Make the repository public, OR
# 2. Upgrade to GitHub Team/Enterprise with Advanced Security
#
# For now, the CI workflow provides sufficient code quality checks.
